# Project 1 - Crossword Puzzle

First project on Software Engineer Immersive cohort at General Assembly.

## Project Goals

Display mastery on usage of DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation

### Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Sass)
- Javascript

### Challenge

Students were given 5 (five) games to work on using Javascript to render the game on the DOM make it interactive.

I proposed to work on a different game, since I've already done most of them before, and chose Crossword Puzzle to be my first project in the course to get a new challenge.
