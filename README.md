# Project 1 - Crossword Puzzle

First project on Software Engineer Immersive cohort at General Assembly.

## Project Goals

Display mastery on usage of DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.

### Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Sass)
- Javascript

### Challenge

Students were given 5 (five) games to work on using Javascript to render the game on the DOM make it interactive.

I proposed to work on a different game, since I've already done most of them before, and chose Crossword Puzzle to be my first project in the course to get a new challenge.

## Version 2.0

After finishing the project with all the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) tasks done, I encountered some issues when trying to implement the Stretch Goals, so I decided to make Version 2.0, where I will have a better code structure to work with.

As resources to do a better project I'm using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/) and the [LA Times' Crossword format](https://www.latimes.com/games/crossword) as inspiration.
